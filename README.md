# Customer Order Management

In order to create favorable conditions and increase interaction between homeroom teachers and
students’ parents, a primary school wants to build a learning management Module for primary
school students. The module can allow parents and students to monitor their students’ learning
at school, as well as help teachers easily contact parents when needed and send notices requesting
homework in order to minimize errors in recording student requests. In addition, the system also
helps teachers to easily enter and correct grades directly on the system to help increase work
efficiency
